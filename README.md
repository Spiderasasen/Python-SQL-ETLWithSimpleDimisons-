# Python-SQL-ETLWithSimpleDimisons-
What i have created in my class to learn how to incorrupt SQL code and Python code together.

# Reason for the code
I did this code while i was in class. Learning how to add SQL code to a language I'm more familiar with. Python. While yes, this GitHub has had a bunch of HTML, CSS, and JS code. I want to add more and more code that i have to my GitHub, just in case anything wrong could happen to my computer. Call it a way to achieve all my projects and code.
